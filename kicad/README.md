# KiCad Circuits

KiCad ([kicad.org](https://www.kicad.org/)) is a FOSS application for designing circuits and printed circuit boards.
It was used to create the circuit schematics for this project.

There are three KiCad circuit projects in this directory:
* [LCD_Test_Generator](LCD_Test_Generator), a 250Hz AC square wave generator for testing bare LCD displays using a PICLF19156 MCU
* [LCD_Test_Generator_PIC12F1572](LCD_Test_Generator_PIC12F1572), the same generator, butusing a smaller, cheaper PIC12F1572 MCU
* [LCD_Demo](LCD_Demo), a demonstration of driving an LCD from a PICLF19156 MCU
