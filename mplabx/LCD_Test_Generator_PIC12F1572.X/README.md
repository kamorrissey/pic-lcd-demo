# LCD Test Signal Generator (PICF1572)

The firmware here generates two complementary 250Hz 3VDC square waves using PIC12F1572 pins RA4 and RA5 (named in code SIGOUTA and SIGOUTB respectively).
The signal across the pins it a 3VAC square wave.
A series capacitor in one leg is used to block any DC current.
