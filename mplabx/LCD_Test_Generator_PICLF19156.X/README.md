# LCD Test Signal Generator (PICLF19156)

The firmware here generates two complementary 250Hz 3VDC square waves using PIC16LF19156 pins RC0 and RC1 (named in code SIGOUTA and SIGOUTB respectively).
The signal across the pins is a 3VAC square wave.
A series capacitor in one leg is used to block any DC current.
